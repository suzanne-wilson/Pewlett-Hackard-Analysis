# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
Module 7
Saved as a README.md, the technical report should consist of at least three paragraphs:

In your first paragraph, introduce the problem that you were using data to solve.
Over the next several years, PH will have a cohort of experienced employees reach retirement.  This presents an opportunity for PH to transfer some of the collective wisdom from these soon-to-retire employees to mid-career employees through the impementation of a mentoring program.  The objective of this report is to describe the cohort to demonstrate the opportunity, identify employees in the retiring cohort who could serve as mentors by department and job title, and employees who are potential mentees born in 1965.  

In your second paragraph, summarize the steps that you took to solve the problem, as well as the challenges that you encountered along the way. This is an excellent spot to provide examples and descriptions of the code that you used.
There were x steps taken to meet these objectives:
1) Create an SQL database containing the PH employee data, which is currently stored in Excel files

2) Create a table containing one row for each retiring employee that contains the employee number, full name, current title and salary, and start date in current role.

3)Create a table with the number of retiring employees by job title.

4)Create a table with all current employees born in 1965.

In your final paragraph, share the results of your analysis and discuss the data that youâ€™ve generated. Have you identified any limitations to the analysis? What next steps would you recommend?



Be sure to include an image of the ERD you created when mapping out the database in your README.md.

Remember that the ability to discuss your work effectively is what will set you apart as a data professional.
